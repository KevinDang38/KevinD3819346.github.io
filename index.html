    <h2><strong>Name:<strong/> Dang Anh Huy<h2/>
    <h2>Student ID: s3819346<h2/>
    <h2>Email address: kevindang2705@gmail.com<h2/>
    <h2>Nationality and spoken language: Vietnamese<h2/>
    <h2>Hobby: I love playing video games, especially a fast pace shooter game such as CS:GO or Call of Duty, I am also addicted to listening to music and watching movies mainly fantasy or action type of genres.<h2/>
  
  <h1>Interest in IT:<h1/>  
   <h2> <p>I have always been a tech addict since I was a child, my dad who is an enthusiast teach me a lot about technology and how it could have a great impact in the future and that gives me a tremendous passion to pursue this major. I regularly get to lay my hands on the newest technology and to understand the mechanisms of how things work.<p/>
    <p>In today's world, there is a lot of problems that relate to information leakage and that creates a huge exposure of users' data on the Internet unintentionally or sometimes on purpose. It could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data about a person’s life, address, phone numbers or where do they live. Perhaps have a greater impact if a company’s private project or design gets expose online, it would cause a lot of damage to the company’s reputation. Therefore, I think it is my duty to pursue cybersecurity, it demonstrates how we can avoid and counter if someone is trying to exploit the data and then prevent that from happening.<p/>
    <p>The reason why I chose RMIT Saigon is that the infrastructure of this university is the best there is, and also studying in the international environment prepares me with a lot of useful skills and helps to elevate my communication skills. And there is a great chance that after you finish the program you have better opportunities than students at other universities in Vietnam.<p/>
    <p>After the Bachelor of IT course, I hope that I could be more confident and have no problem with coding and understand all about the coding language that I need, also an improvement of my lack of communication and social skills.<p/><h2/>
